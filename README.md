# Dominque Cox Python for Data 911 Montgomery PA Calls By Reason

### Prerequisites

Took data from Kaggle.com https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert regarding Montgomery PA 911 repsponse calls. I took the data and narrowed the data down to the reasons for each 911 call in the county. After getting the three reasons I was able to pull the number of calls for each reason using python to show the amount of calls happening in that area. I used a csv file and loaded it into a Jupyter Notebook and manilpulated the data with Python3. I then used a SQLite3 database to save my db in RAM. I then used the pulled data to plot my bar graph displaying the results of 911 calls by reason. Using matplotlib and Seaborn I was able to visualize the project. 


## Getting Started
